# What is this project?

This project is a simple Todo / notepad application created for learning and practice.

## About

This project started as a learning project based on a Udemy React course.
I refactored and extended it with a focus on architecture and scalability:

- Migration from Vite to Next.js App Router
- Type-safe domain model (Todo entity with id)
- Component-based architecture & CSS Modules
- Clear separation of concerns (app / components / hooks / lib)
- Planned REST API integration (Fastify + MySQL)

The current goal is to evolve it into a full-stack Todo application.

## Reference

This project was initially inspired by the following Udemy course:

- [Udemy course link](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern_javascipt_react_beginner/)

## Roadmap

- [ ] Design REST API
- [ ] Implement todo-api (Fastify)
- [ ] Connect frontend to API
- [ ] Persist data with MySQL
- [ ] Add authentication (optional)

## Motivation

The purpose of this project is to go beyond UI implementation and practice:

- application design
- state management
- domain modeling
- full-stack integration
